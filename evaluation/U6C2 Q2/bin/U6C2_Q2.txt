Q2/- Explain the difference between JPA and Hibernate, and
What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?


Ans.

JPA: 

JPA refers to Java Persistence API.

It helps in management of DB in java applications.

It is basically a specification only and many ORM tools like Hibernate implements
it.

It can be found in javax.persistence package.

It basically uses JPQL as an language to perform databases modifications.

************************************************************************

Hibernate:

Hibernate is a ORM tool which is used to save an object into database.

It is purely an implementation of JPA. 

It can be found in org.hibernate package.

It is one of the most famous implementation tool of JPA.

Apart from JPA implementations it also contains some Hibernate specific
implementations also.

Advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC:

While using Hibernate we can deal with data in an object-oriented-manner
but in case of JDBC we can't.

We do not need to remember complex SQL queries while using Hibernate.

Readability of code increases when we use Hibernate in place of JDBC.

Complexity of code decreases when we use Hibernate in place of JDBC.

Code becomes more reusable in case of Hibernate.

Data Modification becomes much more simpler in case of Hibernate.
