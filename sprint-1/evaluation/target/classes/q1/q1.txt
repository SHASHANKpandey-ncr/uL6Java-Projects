What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

Ans.

Advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC are as follows:

1. We don't need to write and remember SQL queries while using Hibernate but while
	using JDBC we must write and remember the exact SQL queries.

2. We can follow object oriented approach to manipulate data of our project while
	we are using Hibernate but this is not a case with JDBC.
	
3. Hibernate hides the database queries in our application or project but in JDBC 
	WE CAN'T DO SO.
	
4. When the project or application is heavy and having 100+ tables in it's database
	then we can use Hibernate to reduce the code and to give our project better 
	readability and hence we maintain our application very easily when we are using  			
	Hibernate but all these advantages are not applicable when we are using JDBC.
